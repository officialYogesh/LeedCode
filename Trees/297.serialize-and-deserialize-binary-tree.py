# Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a
# sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or
# transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the
# same or another computer environment.
# 
# Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no
# restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work.
# You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and
# this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
# 
# Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes
# a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please
# be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 
# 
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        res = []

        def dfs(node):
            if not node: 
                res.append("N")
                return

            res.append(str(node.val))
            dfs(node.left)
            dfs(node.right)
        
        dfs(root)
        return ",".join(res)
        

    def deserialize(self, data):
        vals = data.split(",")
        self.i = 0

        def dfs():
            if vals[self.i] == "N": 
                self.i += 1
                return None

            node = TreeNode(int(vals[self.i]))
            self.i += 1
            node.left = dfs()
            node.right = dfs()
